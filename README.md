#### A small collection of my Miscellaneous notebooks and scripts.

* [Blog1_DogBreedClassification(Keras).ipynb](./Blog1_DogBreedClassification(Keras).ipynb) is notebook for my first Medium Blog [Working with Kaggle Dataset on Google Colab(Free GPU)](https://medium.com/@vivekpothina/working-with-kaggle-dataset-on-google-colab-d3d4a77ead62).
* [LogisticRegressionMNIST.ipynb] is notebook where using Tensorflow, I made a Logistic Regression Model for the all-famous MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset.
* [TensorflowBasics.ipynb] is notebook which was used to take notes when I was learning Tensorflow for the first time.
* [SentimentalAnalysis.ipynb] is my very first experiments what Machine Learning can do. I was just exploring by trying different snippets from the internet.
* [ScheduledArticleReading.py] is a Beautiful Soup web parser I used to scrap articles from [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/) to read articles at specified intervals of the day. \(Just wrote this code, to prepare for GRE reading comprehensions, and to be a little geeky\)
* [downloadStuff.py] is a Beautiful Soup web parser I use all the time to parse basic links pages like "Index of/ " pages on web to get all the downloadable links and trigger the download of the link using Internet Download Manager (IDM) with specified interval. To use this, put the code in the same directory as Internet Download Manager in your file system and run it with Pyhton2. \(A script just to automate stuff and let me be more lazy\)
